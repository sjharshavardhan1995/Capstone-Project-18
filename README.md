# Capstone-Project-18 - Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Project

**Overview**

This project focuses on developing machine learning models for predicting the 10-year mortality risk of breast cancer patients using survival analysis techniques and various machine learning algorithms. The objective is to analyze key clinical features, evaluate different models, and visualize results to provide insights into breast cancer prognosis.

**Dataset**

The project utilizes the Breast Cancer METABRIC dataset, which contains clinical and genomic data for breast cancer patients. The dataset includes various patient attributes such as age, tumor characteristics, molecular subtype, and survival outcomes.

**Objectives**

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key patterns in the dataset.
Train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting breast cancer survival.
Compare different machine learning algorithms for mortality risk prediction.
Analyze feature importance to identify key factors influencing survival outcomes.

**Methodology**

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and categorical variables.

Feature scaling and selection.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions, correlations, and survival trends.

3. Model Development:

Implementing survival analysis techniques.

Training machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.

4. Model Evaluation:

Comparing model performance using accuracy metrics such as AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall, and Survival Curves.

**Technologies Used**

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Lifelines (for survival analysis)

**Results**

The project evaluates different models based on their predictive accuracy and ability to generalize well to unseen data. The results help in understanding key factors influencing breast cancer survival rates.

**Conclusion**

Summary of findings and potential next steps, including suggestions for further model improvement or additional data collection.
